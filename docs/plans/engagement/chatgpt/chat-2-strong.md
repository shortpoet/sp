Awesome. I’ll synthesize your plan with the critique you pasted, challenge where it helps, and turn it into a tight execution playbook you can run immediately.

# What I agree with, and where I’ll push back

**Agree (keep):**

* Three pillars are right: ship real deltas → tell the story → run a disciplined search.
* Lean away from generic “AI agents” content; **lead with engineering judgment** and receipts.
* Audience-aware framing (HM/PM/Recruiter/Dev) matters more than deep code dumps.

**Pushback (refinements):**

* **Don’t over-rotate to “quality over quantity” apps.** Early pipeline needs volume *and* precision. Run a 2-week A/B:

  * Week A: 15 targeted apps + 20 touchpoints.
  * Week B: 6 ultra-targeted apps + 12 touchpoints.
  * Keep the mix that generates screens.
* **Beware “portfolio rabbit holes.”** Cap each website delta to a 2–3 day timebox with a visible outcome (demo + metric). Park extras to the backlog.
* **“Culture/community” must be made concrete.** Use a weighted scorecard (below). Otherwise you’ll “vibe” your way into false positives.

# North Star (constraints → strategy → metrics)

* **Role**: Staff-leaning IC (Platform/DevEx/DevOps) where you ship tools, improve DX, and own architecture decisions.
* **Work model**: Remote-first; Tampa/Austin only if the *team* is exceptional and offers comp/growth parity. Costa Rica: keep as lifestyle option; optimize for US comp.
* **Comp signal**: Last comp \$180k + benefits + options; optimize for **TC + learning + autonomy**.
* **Why you** (messaging): “I ship leverage.” (measurable deltas that compound: reliability, dev speed, cost, clarity)
* **Weekly success bar**: 15 apps (or the winning A/B rate), 20 touchpoints, 2 interviews advanced, 2 posts, 1 portfolio delta.

# Company Fit Scorecard (weight this to kill “vibes”)

Weight to 100. Score targets 1–5 each; multiply by weight.

* Team quality/mentorship (25)
* Decision hygiene (design docs, ADRs, RCAs) (15)
* Growth path for ICs (10)
* Remote maturity (async docs, timezone overlap, RTO risk) (15)
* Problem domain match (fin/devtools/data/infra) (10)
* Engineering leverage (platform/DX impact) (15)
* Total compensation & benefits (10)

Keep this in your tracker (you’ve got the workbook)—sort by weighted total before investing time.

# “Evidence of Impact” portfolio (small, shippable deltas)

**Principle:** One delta → one measurable improvement → one short narrative → receipts.

| Delta (ship in 2–3 days)                      | Proof artifact                             | Business metric                          | Post angle (primary audience)                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **PDF modernization** (print route + Worker)  | Before/after size, selectable text, timing | Size ↓95%+, DX ↑ (copyable text), TTFD ↓ | “Engineering solutions for real problems” (HM/PM) |
| **Vuex → Pinia + TS store** (core slice only) | Diff, types caught, bug class eliminated   | Onboarding speed ↑, prod defect class ↓  | “Modernization as risk reduction” (HM/PM)         |
| **Vitest unification** (one runner)           | CI time chart, flake rate trend            | CI time ↓, flake ↓                       | “Make tests fast and trustworthy” (Tech Lead)     |
| **UI snapshot capture in CI**                 | Snapshot gallery, PR check                 | Review time ↓, regressions caught ↑      | “Visual evidence that scales” (PM/Dev)            |
| **Docs sweep** (README, sitemap, lint/env)    | PR links, broken-link report               | Candidate time-to-setup ↓                | “Docs that hire” (Recruiter/HM)                   |

> Cap each to a \~2–3 day timebox, ship, and move. Depth comes from the **series**, not any single piece.

# Content strategy (judgment-forward, recruiter-friendly)

**Format for every post:**
**TL;DR (3 bullets)** → **Before/After metrics** → **Decision trade-offs** → **Nerd corner** (code links) → **CTA** (“DM if you have this problem” / demo link).

**Content pillars (ratio):**

* **Technical Judgment (40%)** – Decision frameworks, trade-offs, rollbacks, failure modes.
* **Process Innovation (35%)** – AI-in-the-loop that actually helps (planning → replanning → retros).
* **Career/Industry (25%)** – Remote-first execution, cross-cultural teams, learning systems.

**6-Post starter queue (2–3 weeks):**

1. From 20MB to 200KB: engineering, not gimmicks (HM/PM).
2. When to build vs. buy PDF pipelines (framework + checklist) (HM/PM).
3. JS→TS where it pays first: stores/router/utils (Tech Lead).
4. Visual documentation that actually gets used (PM/Dev).
5. AI-assisted development as a discipline (plans, constraints, receipts—not “vibes”) (HM/Dev).
6. Docs that hire: turning your README into a 5-minute audition (Recruiter/HM).

> Cross-post: LinkedIn (short), your site (full). Add one chart or artifact per post—no walls of text.

# Interview prep (logic trees you can rehearse)

**A) System/Architecture: “Edge PDF pipeline”**
Prompt → Clarify context (volume, formats, auth, A11y) → Constraints (cost, cold-starts, latency) → Design (route → render → store → serve; fallback path; feature flag) → **Risks** (HTML edge cases, memory) → **Mitigations** (timeouts, retries, circuit breaker) → **Metrics** (p95 latency, size, error budget) → **Rollout** (dark launch → 10% → 100%) → **RCA posture** (logs, traces, redaction).

**B) Modernization: “Vuex → Pinia safely”**
Inventory slices → Identify high-churn first → Anti-goals (no freeze, no big-bang) → Dual-run adapter layer → Type boundaries first (DTOs) → Incremental PRs with contract tests → Feature flags by slice → Rollback plan → Done criteria (defect rate, perf comparable, DX feedback).

**C) Incident/Ownership: “Release used wrong build #”**
Detect (monitor/version check) → Contain (pause release) → Diagnose (mismatch in artifact promotion) → Fix (immutable artifact by commit; single source of version truth) → Prove (post-incident test) → Prevent (policy + CI guard + doc).
Have 2–3 STAR stories ready per category (conflict, impact with no authority, ambiguity, learning from failure).

# Search & outreach (pipeline you can actually sustain)

**Application rhythm (A/B for 2 weeks):**

* **A:** 15 targeted apps/wk + 20 touchpoints (recruiters, HMs, senior ICs).
* **B:** 6 ultra-targeted apps/wk + 12 touchpoints (deep research + tailored pitch).
  Keep whichever yields more screens per hour invested.

**Outbound message skeleton (5–7 lines):**

* Their current pain (from blog/issues/incidents).
* One result you’ve shipped that maps to that pain.
* One crisp idea you’d try there (not a lecture).
* Soft CTA (15-min chat / “happy to share the checklist we used”).

**Targets:** Remote-first product orgs, platform/devtools, data infra; Series B–D sweet spot (learning × stability). Use your Excel tracker’s “Fit Score” and “Risk Flags” columns aggressively.

---

# Compensation & narrative

* State range as **TC + remote flexibility** valued (esp. for Spain/Philippines ties).
* Trade non-cash levers: L5/L6 leveling, conf/learning budgets, good on-call, stable roadmap involvement.
* Reframe the Lazlo exit: “I’m optimizing for high-trust environments where product, platform, and people are aligned. I’m proud of what I shipped; now I want the right arena.”

# 10-Day sprint (do this now)

**Day 1–2**

* Ship **PDF Phase-1** (print path + selectable text) with before/after artifacts.
* Draft Post #1 (<=500 words) using the shared format.
* Fill the **Company Fit Scorecard** for 10 targets.

**Day 3–4**

* Outreach to 10 people (2 recruiters, 2 HMs, 6 ICs across targets).
* Mock: “Edge PDF pipeline” logic tree (45 min).
* Queue **PDF Phase-2** tasks (Worker + storage + download endpoint).

**Day 5**

* Publish Post #1 (LinkedIn + site).
* Apply to the A/B week’s quota.

**Day 6–7**

* Ship **Docs sweep** (README, sitemap, lint/env).
* Draft Post #2 (“Docs that hire”).
* Mock: “Vuex→Pinia safely” + 2 behavioral STARs.

**Day 8–10**

* Publish Post #2.
* Ship **Vitest unification** (small but visible).
* Apply + follow-ups; review metrics; choose A or B cadence.

# Where AI fits (and doesn’t)

Use AI for **planning → scaffolding → critique → retro**, not decisions. Great uses:

* Compose first-draft posts; you fill in receipts.
* Generate checklists and test matrices; you adapt to context.
* Interview drills (I can play HM/PM/Staff IC).
  Avoid: overproduced agent demos without shipped value.

# Your next two deliverables (I can draft on the spot)

1. **LinkedIn About** (remote-first, leverage-driven, IC leadership).
2. **Post #1 skeleton** with placeholders for your before/after artifacts.

If you want those now, say the word and I’ll drop both fully written—ready to paste.
