Love the focus. Here’s a compact “Job-Search OS” that ties your goals, your site plans, and your content together so you can execute fast.

# Action plan (tight + complete)

## 1) Strategy & targets (North Star)

* Roles: Platform Engineer / DevEx / Staff-level DevOps where you ship tools & DX (matches your aim to blend SWE + DevOps).
* Work model: Remote-first; consider Tampa/Austin only for A+ team/career upside.
* Filters: Team culture (learn-it-all, high-trust), IC growth path, code ownership, mentorship, low RTO risk.
* Success metrics (weekly): 15 targeted apps, 20 quality touchpoints, 2 interview loops advanced, 2 posts published, 1 portfolio delta shipped.

## 2) Weekly cadence (rinse & repeat)

* Mon: Target list refresh (roles/teams), tailor resume, 3–5 apps, 4 outreach, draft 1 post.
* Tue: Mock interview (45m), 3–5 apps, 4 outreach, publish post #1.
* Wed: Portfolio delta (see §4), 3–5 apps, recruiter follow-ups.
* Thu: Interview drills (systems/DevEx scenarios), 4 outreach, draft post #2.
* Fri: Publish post #2, pipeline review, retro (what worked/what to change), schedule next week’s targets.

## 3) Tracking (ready-to-use files)

I made lightweight templates you can open/edit now:

* [Download the Job Application Tracker](sandbox:/mnt/data/job-application-tracker.csv)
* [Download the Content Calendar](sandbox:/mnt/data/content-calendar.csv)
* [Download the Seed Post Ideas](sandbox:/mnt/data/post-ideas-seed.csv)

Columns are tuned for signal (fit/excitement/flags), next actions, follow-ups, and resume version. Add automations later if you want.

## 4) Turn your website plans into tasks + posts (hire-friendly angles)

Below are concrete build tasks mapped to post angles for both technical readers and hiring audiences. (You already have strong plans—this just reframes them for outcomes.)

### A. PDF modernization

**Ship list**

* Phase 1 (today/tomorrow): Add print-optimized route/styles; replace rasterization; keep legacy behind a flag.
* Phase 2 (this week): Cloudflare Worker + Browser Rendering, R2 storage, download endpoint; basic analytics.
* Phase 3 (later): Summaries/translations/watermarks; perf metrics.

**Posts to publish**

1. “From 20MB to 200KB: The right way to export PDFs” → TL;DR for HMs/PMs (file size ↓95%, selectable text, accessibility), with a short “how” for devs.&#x20;
2. “Cost/quality tradeoffs of print vs worker vs jsPDF.html()” → a one-chart comparison + when to use which.&#x20;
3. “Resilience and rollback in client-to-edge migrations” → feature flags, fallbacks, and metrics you tracked.&#x20;
4. “Implementation diary: route, CSS, and worker endpoints” → brief code snippets & before/after.&#x20;

### B. Codebase modernization

**Ship list**

* Replace Vuex with Pinia + TS for the app store; type router; migrate core utils; enable strict TS; clean test stack.
* Normalize build/test config; remove dead deps.

**Posts to publish**

1. “Why moving from Vuex → Pinia matters to the business” (risk reduction, onboarding speed, bug classes eliminated).&#x20;
2. “JS→TS migration: where types deliver outsized ROI” (stores/router/utils first).&#x20;
3. “Single test runner sanity: consolidating on Vitest” (consistent patterns; faster inner loop).&#x20;

### C. README/docs refresh

**Ship list**

* Fix sitemap hostname; ESLint env typo; article link paths; broaden Vitest includes; (optionally) pin pnpm via Corepack.&#x20;

**Posts to publish**

1. “Docs that hire: making a recruiter-friendly README” (setup in minutes, routes, CI, SEO gotchas).&#x20;
2. “Tiny fixes, big polish: sitemap, lint, links, tests” (receipts + diffs).&#x20;
3. “Discovery notes as living docs: web + code scans” (quick scan ritual, snapshots).&#x20;

### D. UI snapshot capture (optional but slick)

**Ship list**

* Add headless capture script; route list; artifact upload in CI; gallery under `docs/`.&#x20;

**Posts to publish**

1. “Lightweight visual evidence in CI: UI snapshot captures” (how it complements unit tests).&#x20;
2. “Keeping it lean: reusing router + preview for snapshots” (no duplicate configs).&#x20;

## 5) Content framework (so every post lands with recruiters)

* Format: **TL;DR (2–3 bullets)** → **Outcome metrics** → **Why it matters to the business** → **Nerd corner** (code/links) → **CTA** (demo, repo, or “DM me if you have this problem”).
* Pillars: **Proof of Work** (shipped deltas), **Process** (trade-offs, checklists), **Perspective** (how this reduces risk / cost / lead time).
* Cadence: 2 posts/week (Tue/Fri); cross-post to site as Markdown + LinkedIn. Keep posts concise; thread longer ones.

## 6) Interview prep (logic trees you can rehearse)

* **Behavioral (STAR)**: theme → situation → actions → measurable impact → lesson. Branches: conflict, prioritization, influence without authority, fail/learn loops.
* **DevEx/Platform scenario**: *If* asked about “CI/CD bottleneck” → clarify constraints → surface trade-offs (cost, blast radius, MTTR) → propose minimal path (feature flag + observability) → rollback plan → metrics.
* **Architecture**: *If* asked “secure multi-tenant edges” → authn/z strategy → routing → secrets → rate-limit → observability → failure modes → migration path.
  We can spin up full trees next—say, “migrate Vuex→Pinia safely” and “PDF pipeline at the edge,” with rubrics you can role-play.

## 7) Targeting & portals (pragmatic)

* Primary channels: LinkedIn (saved searches + recruiter reach-outs), Built In/Wellfound/Otta for product tech; company career pages for top targets; niche DevEx/platform teams via GitHub orgs and engineering blogs.
* Daily outreach mix: 2 recruiters, 2 engineers on the target team, 1 hiring manager (personalized, 5–7 lines, problem-oriented).

## 8) 48-hour checklist (start line)

* Ship Phase-1 PDF print path + post #1 draft.
* Fix README polish items (sitemap/env/links/tests) and publish a tiny “sweeps” post.
* Create three resume variants (Platform Eng, DevEx, Staff DevOps) and tag in the tracker.
* Book two mocks with me: (1) behavioral, (2) platform scenario.
* Queue 20 targets; send 10 intros; schedule 5 follow-ups in the tracker.

If you want, I can also drop a ready-to-paste LinkedIn About + the first two post skeletons next.
