Your clarifications help refine the strategy significantly. Let me restructure the approach based on these parameters:

## Market Reality Check

At $180k+ with remote flexibility, you're in a competitive bracket where companies have high expectations. The "culture and learning" priority is smart - these environments typically offer better long-term growth than pure compensation plays. However, there's tension between wanting startup culture/learning and needing stability for international family considerations.

## Revised Geographic Strategy

Your "audition cities" approach makes sense, but creates complexity:

- **Remote-first applications**: Cast wider net, negotiate visits/trials
- **Tampa/Austin targeted**: Apply to companies offering relocation packages
- **International consideration**: Research visa/tax implications for Costa Rica positions early

The family dynamics (Spain/Philippines) actually strengthen your remote work case - this is a legitimate business need, not just preference.

## Refined Content Strategy

Given your compensation range and career stage, your content should demonstrate **senior-level decision making** rather than just technical execution. Here's a reframed approach:

### Core Content Pillars

**1. Technical Judgment** (40% of content)

- PDF optimization story: "When 95% improvement isn't enough"
- Migration decisions: "TypeScript adoption: timing vs velocity"
- Architecture choices: "Edge computing for resume generation: overkill or future-proof?"

**2. Process Innovation** (35% of content)

- AI-assisted development workflows
- Documentation as product thinking
- Cross-cultural remote team dynamics (draws on your international background)

**3. Career/Industry Insights** (25% of content)

- Remote work evolution in tech
- Learning strategies for mid-career developers
- Building technical communities

## Job Search Execution Plan

### Target Company Types

1. **Series B-D startups** (100-500 people) - Balance of learning/stability
2. **Remote-first companies** with international teams
3. **Platform/infrastructure companies** where your skills have multiplier effect

### Application Methodology

- **Quality over quantity**: 3-5 deeply researched applications per week
- **Network activation**: Leverage LinkedIn connections for warm introductions
- **Company research**: Understand their technical challenges before applying

### Interview Preparation Framework

**Technical interviews**: Focus on system design and architectural decisions
**Behavioral**: Prepare stories around:

- Leading without authority
- Technical decision trade-offs
- Cross-cultural collaboration
- Handling ambiguous requirements

## Critical Considerations

**Compensation negotiation**: Your current $180k is solid, but with family international needs, consider total compensation including benefits, time off, and remote work stipends.

**Visa/location flexibility**: Document this clearly in applications - companies appreciate transparency about constraints.

**Learning goals**: Be specific about what you want to learn. "Better engineering practices" is vague; "distributed systems at scale" or "product engineering in fintech" shows focus.

## Potential Pitfalls

Your international family situation could be seen as complexity by some employers. Frame it as an asset - you understand global markets and asynchronous collaboration.

The "culture and community" focus is admirable but subjective. Develop concrete criteria for evaluating companies beyond vibes - team structure, decision-making processes, learning budgets, etc.

Moving from Lazlo due to trust issues is valid, but avoid discussing this negatively in interviews. Focus on seeking growth opportunities instead.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Research phase**: Identify 20-30 target companies that match your criteria
2. **Content calendar**: Plan 8-10 articles over next 2 months
3. **Network mapping**: Identify connections at target companies
4. **Interview prep**: Practice system design problems weekly

Your technical skills are clearly strong, but at senior levels, companies hire for judgment and cultural fit. The challenge is demonstrating these qualities through content and interviews while maintaining authenticity about your priorities.
