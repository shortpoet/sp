# Content-Driven Development Plan: Website Updates with Job Search Integration

> **📁 Source Context**: Synthesis of ChatGPT and Claude job search guidance  
> **🎯 Goal**: Integrate website development with content creation and job search activities  
> **✅ Prerequisites**: Existing Vue 3 + Vite SSG site, PDF modernization plan ready, codebase modernization plan ready

## 🔄 **Comprehensive Implementation Plan: Content-First Development Strategy**

### **Current State Analysis**

**Key Insights from Agent Refinement:**

1. **Sustainable Pace Over Volume**: 3-5 quality applications/week beats 15 rushed ones
2. **Engineering Judgment Focus**: Content should demonstrate decision-making, not just technical skills
3. **Fast Iteration Advantage**: Your ability to ship quickly is a competitive differentiator
4. **Income Reality**: 2-3 month runway needed, but fast shipping can create opportunities

**Problems Identified:**

1. **Content Creation Friction**: Need systematic capture of technical decisions during coding
2. **Visibility Gap**: Completed work not translating to demonstrable portfolio pieces
3. **Process Documentation**: No structured way to capture lessons learned for articles
4. **Measurement Void**: No metrics to show impact of technical improvements

### **🎯 Implementation Strategy: Content-Driven Development Workflow**

#### **Core Principle: Every Code Change is a Content Opportunity**

Each development task will follow this content-capture workflow:

```mermaid
Plan → Code → Capture → Reflect → Publish
   ↑                               ↓
   └──────── Feedback Loop ────────┘
```

### **📋 Phase 1: PDF Modernization with Content Integration (Week 1-2)**

#### **Day 1-2: Quick Win Implementation**

**Development Checkpoints:**

```typescript
// Checkpoint 1: Baseline Metrics Capture
interface PDFMetrics {
  beforeSize: number;      // Document in MB
  afterSize: number;       // Document in KB
  reductionPercent: number;
  generationTime: number;  // In seconds
  textSelectable: boolean;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// app/src/utils/metrics-capture.ts
export class MetricsCapture {
  private metrics: PDFMetrics[] = [];
  
  captureBaseline(size: number, time: number) {
    // Capture for before/after comparison
    this.metrics.push({
      beforeSize: size,
      afterSize: 0,
      reductionPercent: 0,
      generationTime: time,
      textSelectable: false,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
  }
  
  captureImprovement(size: number, time: number) {
    const baseline = this.metrics[0];
    const improvement = {
      beforeSize: baseline.beforeSize,
      afterSize: size,
      reductionPercent: ((baseline.beforeSize - size) / baseline.beforeSize) * 100,
      generationTime: time,
      textSelectable: true,
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
    
    // Auto-generate content snippet
    this.generateContentSnippet(improvement);
    return improvement;
  }
  
  private generateContentSnippet(metrics: PDFMetrics) {
    // Create markdown snippet for article
    const snippet = `
### Performance Impact
- **File Size**: ${metrics.beforeSize}MB → ${(metrics.afterSize/1024).toFixed(2)}MB (${metrics.reductionPercent.toFixed(1)}% reduction)
- **Generation Time**: ${metrics.generationTime}s
- **Text Selection**: ✅ Enabled
- **Accessibility**: ✅ Screen reader compatible
    `;
    
    // Save to content drafts
    this.saveContentDraft(snippet);
  }
}
```

**Content Capture Points:**

1. **Before Implementation**: Screenshot current PDF, document file size
2. **During Implementation**: Git commits with clear messages for diff capture
3. **After Implementation**: New metrics, visual comparison

**Reflection Checkpoint** (30 min after implementation):

## Decision Log: PDF Modernization

### Why Browser Print Over Worker (Phase 1)?
- **Time to Market**: 1 day vs 1 week
- **Risk Mitigation**: No infrastructure changes
- **Fallback Strategy**: Legacy method still available
- **Cost**: $0 immediate investment

### Trade-offs Accepted:
- Browser dependency for initial solution
- Manual trigger vs automated generation
- Client-side processing limitations

### Metrics That Matter:
- Developer time saved: 2 hours/week on PDF issues
- Support tickets reduced: Expected 70% decrease
- User satisfaction: Measurable via feedback form
```

#### **Day 3: Content Creation from Implementation**

**Article Structure Template:**

```markdown
# From 20MB to 200KB: A Decision Framework for PDF Optimization

## TL;DR (3 bullets)
- Reduced PDF size by 95% using browser print API instead of canvas rasterization
- Maintained text selection and accessibility without infrastructure changes
- Delivered in 1 day vs 1 week for full edge solution

## The Problem: Business Impact
[Insert baseline metrics and user complaints]

## The Decision: Why Print API First?
[Insert decision log content]

## Implementation: Key Code Changes
[Insert git diffs with annotations]

## Results: Measurable Outcomes
[Insert metrics comparison table]

## Next Steps: Progressive Enhancement
- Phase 2: Edge worker for consistency
- Phase 3: AI enrichment for summaries

## Key Takeaway
Sometimes the "good enough" solution that ships today beats the perfect solution next month.

### **📋 Phase 2: Codebase Modernization with Learning Documentation (Week 3-4)**

#### **Development + Content Integration Points**

##### Step 1: Vuex to Pinia Migration

```typescript
// Content Capture: Document the "why" alongside the "what"
interface MigrationDecision {
  component: string;
  reason: string;
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  timeEstimate: number;
  actualTime?: number;
  issuesEncountered?: string[];
  lessonsLearned?: string[];
}

// Track decisions for content
const migrationLog: MigrationDecision[] = [
  {
    component: 'Resume Store',
    reason: 'High mutation count, complex getters benefit from Pinia simplicity',
    riskLevel: 'medium',
    timeEstimate: 4,
    // Fill in after completion
  }
];
```

##### Checkpoint: After Each Store Migration

1. Capture before/after code snippets
2. Document type errors caught
3. Note developer experience improvements
4. Save as draft content

##### Article Opportunity: "TypeScript Migration ROI: Where Types Pay Off First"

```markdown
## Strategic Order for TS Migration

### High-Value Targets (Week 1)
1. **Stores**: Caught 3 runtime errors in development
2. **Router**: Type-safe navigation prevents broken links
3. **API Utils**: Request/response typing prevents mismatches

### Lower Priority (Week 2+)
1. Mock files (can remain JS)
2. Test utilities (already working)

### Key Learning
Focus TypeScript adoption where runtime errors are most costly, not everywhere equally.
```

### **📋 Phase 3: UI Documentation with Visual Evidence (Week 5)**

#### **Implementation with Content Focus**

```javascript
// app/scripts/capture-screenshots.js
const captureConfig = {
  routes: [
    { path: '/', name: 'Landing', contentTag: 'first-impression' },
    { path: '/resume', name: 'Resume', contentTag: 'core-feature' },
    { path: '/pdf', name: 'PDF', contentTag: 'technical-showcase' }
  ],
  
  captureWithAnnotations: async (route) => {
    const screenshot = await captureRoute(route.path);
    
    // Auto-generate content snippet
    const contentDraft = `
### ${route.name} Page
![${route.name}](./screenshots/${screenshot})
**Purpose**: ${route.contentTag}
**Technical Notes**: Vue 3 SSG, Vite build
**Performance**: [Lighthouse score]
    `;
    
    saveToContentDrafts(contentDraft);
  }
};
```
