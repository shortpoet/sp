# PDF Modernization

The next phase of steps to record will be to systematize the job application process. 

* **PDF modernization (Phase 1):** print-optimized route, selectable text, before/after (size, time-to-first-display).
  Post: *“Optimization as Product Decision: when 95% smaller isn’t the whole story.”*

2) Workflow per Delta (optimize for content + diffs)
   - Plan: define scope (≤2–3 days), success criteria (engineering + content), and slug.
   - Implement: small PR focused on one outcome; keep diffs readable.
   - Validate: `cd app && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build && pnpm preview` (local).
   - Capture: save `git diff -U0` as `diff.patch`; record metrics/screenshots.
   - Reflect: write the journal stub (≤200 words) referencing artifacts.
   - Publish: add/update row in content calendar; schedule LinkedIn/site post.
   - Retro: 3 bullets (worked/changed/next) appended to the journal entry.

3) Near‑Term Delta Queue (mapped to posts)
   - A) PDF Modernization — Phase 1 (print route + selectable text)
     - Engineering: ensure `/pdf` renders accessible, selectable text; size ↓ vs raster; document fallback.
     - Artifacts: before/after PDF size and TTFD; one screenshot; `diff.patch`.
     - Content: Draft “From 20MB → 200KB (engineering, not gimmicks)” (HM/PM primary).
     - Acceptance: build passes; measurable size reduction; journal stub completed; content calendar row status=Draft.

1. **Before Implementation**: Screenshot current PDF, document file size
2. **During Implementation**: Git commits with clear messages for diff capture
3. **After Implementation**: New metrics, visual comparison

## Decision Log: PDF Modernization

### Why Browser Print Over Worker (Phase 1)?
- **Time to Market**: 1 day vs 1 week
- **Risk Mitigation**: No infrastructure changes
- **Fallback Strategy**: Legacy method still available
- **Cost**: $0 immediate investment

### Trade-offs Accepted:
- Browser dependency for initial solution
- Manual trigger vs automated generation
- Client-side processing limitations

### Metrics That Matter:
- Developer time saved: 2 hours/week on PDF issues
- Support tickets reduced: Expected 70% decrease
- User satisfaction: Measurable via feedback form

**Principle:** One delta → one measurable improvement → one short narrative → receipts.

| Delta (ship in 2–3 days)                      | Proof artifact                             | Business metric                          | Post angle (primary audience)                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **PDF modernization** (print route + Worker)  | Before/after size, selectable text, timing | Size ↓95%+, DX ↑ (copyable text), TTFD ↓ | “Engineering solutions for real problems” (HM/PM) |

**6-Post starter queue (2–3 weeks):**

1. From 20MB to 200KB: engineering, not gimmicks (HM/PM).
2. When to build vs. buy PDF pipelines (framework + checklist) (HM/PM).

### Core Content Pillars

**1. Technical Judgment** (40% of content)

- PDF optimization story: "When 95% improvement isn't enough"

### A. PDF modernization

**Ship list**

* Phase 1 (today/tomorrow): Add print-optimized route/styles; replace rasterization; keep legacy behind a flag.
* Phase 2 (this week): Cloudflare Worker + Browser Rendering, R2 storage, download endpoint; basic analytics.
* Phase 3 (later): Summaries/translations/watermarks; perf metrics.

**Posts to publish**

1. “From 20MB to 200KB: The right way to export PDFs” → TL;DR for HMs/PMs (file size ↓95%, selectable text, accessibility), with a short “how” for devs.&#x20;
2. “Cost/quality tradeoffs of print vs worker vs jsPDF.html()” → a one-chart comparison + when to use which.&#x20;
3. “Resilience and rollback in client-to-edge migrations” → feature flags, fallbacks, and metrics you tracked.&#x20;
4. “Implementation diary: route, CSS, and worker endpoints” → brief code snippets & before/after.&#x20;

### Phase 1: PDF Modernization (High Impact Content)

**Technical Tasks:**

- Implement browser print method
- Create Cloudflare Worker solution
- Performance optimization

**Content Angles:**

1. **"From 20MB to 200KB: Engineering Solutions for Real Problems"** - Appeals to PMs/hiring managers who care about user experience
2. **"When to Build vs Buy: PDF Generation Decision Framework"** - Shows business thinking
3. **"Progressive Enhancement in Practice"** - Demonstrates architectural maturity
