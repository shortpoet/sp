## A journey of a thausand miles...

...And other epithets abound to describe the trepidatious feeling of starting a new journey.

One benefit of being an avid and seasoned traveler is that you see challenges and risks as opportunities for growth. The strenght and steadfastness gained and needed for journeys full of challenges is an invaluable feedback loop for life. I am excited to embark on the latest leg of my journey.

One thing my recent work has taught me is the value of thorough planning and iterating quickly, rinse and repeat. Using AI tools effectively involves a feedback loop that is crucial to optimize for results. I want to deliver certain improvements on my website, social media engagement, job search, and personal projects. This provides me an opportunity to showcase and utilize this process in a real-world scenario.
