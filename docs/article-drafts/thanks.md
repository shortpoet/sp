# Thanks

I want to dedicate a thank you to the awesome colleagues at Lazlo 326 that made my experience there so rewarding. Through the cycle of challenges and growth, it was a mutually enriching experience. I want to specially thank my DevOps & Data Engineering teammates (and friends) Tchimwa, Sergiy, Michael, Alex, and Sagi. Thank you for your camaraderie, technical acumen, philosophical generosity, and the many laughs we shared. I will truly miss our time together.

I am deeply touched by the support and LinkedIn recommendations I received â€” especially from colleagues outside my immediate team like Deepa. While times of change can be daunting, the overwhelming positivity and kindness is most encouraging. Thanks again! :)
