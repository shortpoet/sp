# Thanks

I want to dedicate a thank you to the awesome colleagues at Lazlo 326 that made my experience there so rewarding. Through the cycle of challenges aand growth, it was a mutally enriching experience. I want to specially thank my DevOps & Data Engineering teammates (and friends) Tchimwa, Sergiy, Michael, Alex, and Sagi. Thank you for your camraderie, techncial acumen, philosphical generosity, and the many laughs we shared. I will truly miss our time together.

I was deeply touched by the support and LinkedIn recommendations I received. While times of change can be daunting, the overwhelming positivity and kindness is most encouraging. Thanks again! :)
