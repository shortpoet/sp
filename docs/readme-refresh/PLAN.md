# README Refresh Plan (Index)

This plan is split into two focused tracks:

- Documentation-only: see `PLAN.docs.md` for all changes to README/AGENTS and related docs.
- Code/config touches: see `PLAN.code.md` for minimal changes in app/config/CI.

Use this index to navigate and keep scope clear and reviewable.
