# A journey of a thousand miles...

...begins with a single step, as they say. As someone who's navigated career transitions before, I've learned that change often opens the door to unexpected opportunities.

Recent organizational shifts have given me the perfect moment to pursue roles that better align with my remote-first work style and appetite for growth. Rather than seeing this as a setback, I'm approaching it as a strategic move toward finding the right long-term fit.

My recent work has reinforced the value of thorough planning, rapid iteration, and continuous improvement. Whether optimizing AI workflows or building data pipelines, the feedback loop is everything. Now I'm applying that same approach to my job search, website updates, and personal projects â€” turning this transition into a real-world showcase of how I work.

Sometimes we walk what seem like deja vu steps, but what stands out this time is the level of excitement I feel about what's ahead. The confidence comes from knowing what I can deliver and the growth I've accomplished and have to look forward to.

A few notes as I begin sharing this journey:

1. I leverage AI tools extensively, but everything passes through my own review and interpretation
2. I've been using em dashes since long before AI made them trendy (like if you agree ðŸ˜Š)

The AI disclaimer is loosely inspired by a brief moment in this (ever insightful) video from Theo - t3â€¤gg reviewing Nicole Tietz's excellent article on booleans. Worth a watch/read for anyone interested in thoughtful software engineering practices.

Looking forward to connecting and sharing what comes next.
